Hospital Management System
Overview
The Hospital Management System is a console-based C++ application designed to manage hospital records for doctors and patients. It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and exception handling. The system provides an interactive menu-driven interface to add, view, save, and load records.

Features
Add Records: Add doctors and patients to the system.
Display Records: View all existing records.
Save Records: Save doctor and patient details to a file (hospital_data.txt).
Load Records: Load records from a file to restore previous data.
OOP Concepts: Uses inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Exception Handling: Handles file I/O errors and invalid inputs gracefully.
